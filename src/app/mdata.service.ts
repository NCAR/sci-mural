The U.S. Army needed a computer to calculate firing tables. It took the team 18 months to build ENIAC at a cost of $500,000. After World War II, the machine was put to work doing calculations for the hydrogen bomb, weather prediction, and cosmic-ray studies.\nENIAC contained 17,468 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 1,500 relays, and 6,000 manual switches. It covered 1,800 square feet (167 square meters) of floor space, weighed 30 tons, and consumed 160 kilowatts of electrical power. In one second, the giant computer could perform 5,000 additions, 357 multiplications, or 38 divisions. \nImage © Smithsonian Institution",

In the 1940s, Sarnoff reorganized the network to provide television programming.\nIn 1939, Sarnoff used his company's exhibit at the New York World's Fair as a showcase to demonstrate RCA's new line of television receivers – some of which had to be coupled with a radio for sound. The work of numerous engineers and inventors in several countries over many decades combined to produce the television. Electromechanical methods to scan, transmit, and reproduce an image gave way to all-electronic systems, as electronic camera and display tubes were perfected.\nImage © TV Museum",

British scientist Rosalind Franklin was actually the first to discover DNA’s double helix structure using x-rays, but she died before the Noble Prize was awarded.\nA Swiss physician, Johann Friedrich Miescher, isolated DNA in cell nuclei in the late 1800s. In 1952, Watson and Crick demonstrated that each strand of the DNA molecule was a template for the other. During cell division, the two strands separate and create a new \"other half.”  In this way, DNA can reproduce itself without changing its structure. DNA's discovery has been called the most important biological breakthrough of the last 100 years.\nImage © Lawrence Loucka",

The first nuclear generator in the United States became operational a year later in Shippingport, Pennsylvania.  Today, fourteen percent of the world’s electricity is produced through nuclear power.\nNuclear power plants generate electricity like any other steam-electric power plant.  Water is heated and steam from the boiling water turns turbines that generate electricity.  The main difference in the various types of commercial plants is the heat source.  Heat from a self-sustaining chain reaction (fission) boils the water in a nuclear power plant. Coal, oil, or gas is burned in conventional power plants. Nuclear power is our cleanest energy source, but still the most controversial because of the radioactive materials that are used.\nImage © Stefan Kuhn",

They founded the theory of lasers and described how a laser could be built using a similar appliance for microwaves called the MASER.  The MASER was introduced during the 1950s by Bell Labs, but proved much less useful than the laser.\nThe invention of the laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) launched a new scientific field and opened the door to a multibillion-dollar industry.

This led geologists to develop a new way of looking at the world.\nThe theory of plate tectonics does for geology what Charles Darwin's theory of evolution did for biology. It provides a comprehensive model for explaining, \"how the Earth works.”  It is all based on 7 rigid plates (the African, North American, South American, Eurasian, Australian, Antarctic, and Pacific) that are constantly moving – together, apart, or sideways. \nImage © Jens Womer",

Considered a pioneering fertility treatment 25 years ago, IVF has been responsible for an estimated 114,000 babies born in the United States alone.\nIVF is the process of fertilization where eggs and sperm are manually combined in a laboratory dish. When the IVF procedure is successful, the process is coupled with a procedure known as “embryo transfer” that is used to physically place the embryo in the uterus. IVF remains slightly controversial today because of the chance of a multiple pregnancy and the risk of premature delivery, which are both increased in all assisted reproductive procedures.\nImage © HAO/NCAR",

Researchers at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland, used a mammary gland cell from an adult Finn Dorset sheep and transferred it to a developing egg cell to produce a single healthy clone.\nThe creation of Dolly showed the world that the technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer was viable.  In the future, cloning may help in preserving endangered species or in reviving extinct ones. Researchers have found cloning of mammals to be inefficient. The process that cells need to go through is not perfect and embryos produced often develop abnormally. It is doubtful that cloning will ever be efficient enough for use in humans.\n\nImage © Roslin Institute",

This location was known for its clear skies, dry weather, and cloudless days, all ideal for viewing the corona. The observatory was completed in 1965 and the K-coronameter was moved to Mauna Loa.

The ASP helped analyze such phenomena as bright rings around the Sun observed by the Mauna Loa Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (PSPT). These rings—predicted for 25 years, but not observed until the late 1990s—appear to help solve an enduring solar puzzle: why sunspots remain darker and cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface. The ASP confirmed that only a small fraction of the rings' brightness is due to magnetism, which implies that the rings are actually transferring large amounts of heat to the surface. The stacked images from ASP illustrate different properties of magnetic fields in and around a sunspot, such as the strength and direction of the field.\nImage © NCAR/UCAR/NSF",

The annual average value varies from a maximum, plotted here at a peak annual average value of 200, to approximately zero over a period of approximately 11 years. This variation is due to changes in the Sun’s magnetic field. About every 11 years, the number of sunspots reaches a maximum, known as activity maximum, at which time the polarity of the magnetic field reverses; magnetic field lines at the north magnetic pole flip from inward to outward pointing with the opposite occurring in the south magnetic pole region (flipping from outward to inward). The direction flips back again 11 years later, making it a 22 year magnetic activity cycle.\nThe sunspot cycle is known as the magnetic activity cycle because the Sun’s magnetic field creates solar activity, such as flares, high energy particles and explosive events known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which cause space weather storms that create aurora and can disrupt communications and satellites. The amount of energy emitted by the Sun also changes slightly over the solar cycle, with about 1/10 of 1 percent less energy produced at solar minimum.

Mk3 measurements showed that the brightness of the corona varies by nearly a factor of 6 over the 11-year sunspot cycle, attaining its brightest levels during solar maximum.

A total eclipse occurs when the moon moves directly between the Sun and the Earth, blocking all of the bright light from the Sun, allowing the dim corona to come into view in a spectacular display. The purpose of the HAO eclipse expedition to India was to obtain high spatial resolution measurements of the intensity and polarization of the corona. \nThe 1980 eclipse occurred very close in time to the maximum of the solar activity cycle, a time when solar activity is at its peak and bright structures known as streamers are located all around the Sun. HAO also obtained observations for comparison from its new Mk3 K-coronameter and from a rocket-launched coronagraph. The eclipse and other data provided information about the brightness distribution and magnetic field of the corona that was used to construct models of the corona’s density and temperature. This information is needed to determine the causes of solar activity and to ultimately predict their impacts on Earth.\nImage © NCAR/UCAR/NSF",

Light is said to be polarized when many different waves of light vibrate along the same direction, rather than in different directions. In the Sun’s corona, the magnetic field provides the preferred direction to polarize light. Polarization measurements provide information about the magnetic field, including how it organizes the structure of the corona and releases energy that creates solar activity. KELP made successful observations of the direction of the coronal magnetic field. \nKELP observations became even more informative in 1980 when they were combined with new daily images of the solar corona from the Mauna Loa Mk3 K-coronameter. Scientists could relate the direction of the magnetic field provided by KELP to the structures of the corona shown in Mk3 images. This information gave scientists a better understanding of the shape of the coronal magnetic field and helped to determine the sources of the solar wind. \nImage © NCAR/UCAR/NSF",

This is the region in which the space shuttle and space station orbit and where auroral activity occurs. Temperatures in the thermosphere are influenced by solar activity as well as changes from below. \nIn 1989, NCAR/HAO scientists predicted that an increase in the greenhouse gases that cause global warming near the surface would be expected to cool our thermosphere. Cooling the thermosphere causes it to shrink (just as heating a gas causes it to expand). If the Earth’s thermosphere cooled and shrunk, the scientists predicted there would be less drag on orbiting satellites. Recently, the tracks of satellites that zip through the thermosphere in low-Earth orbit have shown a decrease in drag as predicted. The picture of the thermosphere and the overlying plot illustrate the temperature changes with height. The high temperatures found in the thermosphere have cooled measurably in recent years as shown by the shift from dashed to solid red line.

If a planetary system is oriented so that Earth lies near the plane of the planet's orbit, then once per orbit the planet passes between its star and the Earth (shown in the image), causing a transit. During a transit, the planet blocks some of the light from the star, causing the star to appear dimmer. This orientation method favors finding larger planets orbiting close to their parent star. \nSTARE successfully detected large planets around other stars. The observations were used to determine the planets sizes, masses and density, which provided the information needed to determine if the planet was a gas giant like Jupiter, or a rocky planet like Earth.

When the probe's thruster fuel ran low, scientists used the solar panels as sails to make course corrections.\nThe Mariner 10 mission objectives were to measure Venus’ and Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and planetary body characteristics. During its two-year mission, Mariner 10 transmitted over 12,000 images of Mercury and discovered evidence of rotating clouds. Mariner 10 also discovered that Mercury has an atmosphere consisting primarily of Helium, as well as a very weak magnetic field and a large iron-rich core. \nImage © NASA",

SMM malfunctioned one year after launch, and in 1984 it became the first satellite to be repaired in orbit by astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle. The repair provided five more years of valuable observations before SMM burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere in 1989.\nThe coronagraph onboard SMM recorded over 1,300 CME events. Such observations helped scientists to better understand how these phenomena form and how they relate to other types of solar activity. In 1986, the HAO SMM coronagraph pointed towards Halley’s Comet as it made its closest approach to the Sun. It revealed that the conditions in the comet’s head and tail are affected by the solar wind.\n\nImage © NCAR/UCAR/NSF",
